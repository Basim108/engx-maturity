## Commit Comments

When commenting on your commits, it is recommended to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Branch Names

For new branches it is recommended to use "folders" to describe the type of your changes and an issue id if there is one.

For example,

```tech/issue-2-add-job-to-test-data-in-ci```

**tech** means technical changes, for tech debt, ci/cd and other technical activities;

- data/add-incident-management-rules
- feature/issue-9-code-review-check-list-generator
- fix/spelling-issues-in-agile-health-rules
