# 1. Store Engineering Excellence Maturity Rules and Metrics on GitHub

Date: 2025-05-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To effectively manage contributions and maintain the integrity of our engineering excellence maturity rules and metrics dataset from multiple users, we require a version control system. GitHub, with its robust pull request workflow, provides an ideal platform for this purpose.

## Decision

We will store all data related to engineering excellence, including maturity rules and associated metrics, in JSON format. To ensure data consistency and facilitate programmatic validation, we will define a comprehensive JSON schema.

All modifications to the dataset will be managed through GitHub pull requests.

## Consequences

Implementing this decision will provide the following benefits:

- **Version Control:** Git will track all changes to the dataset, allowing for easy rollback and historical analysis.
- **Collaborative Review:** The pull request process will enable thorough review and discussion of proposed changes before they are merged. This review process will serve as a mechanism for data moderation and quality assurance.
- **Transparency:** All changes and discussions will be visible and auditable within the GitHub repository, fostering transparency within the project.
- **Community Contribution:** The familiar GitHub workflow will lower the barrier to entry for community contributions to the dataset.
- **Data Validation:** The defined JSON schema will allow for automated validation of proposed data changes, ensuring data integrity and adherence to the established structure.
