# 2. Use Both Questions and Statements in Engineering Excellence Rules

Date: 2025-07-27

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Engineering Excellence (EngX) rules initially used simple "title" properties to describe practices and standards. As the platform evolved to support assessments and checklists, these titles were transformed into "question" properties using interrogative form, which naturally fit the evaluation workflow.

However, as EngX continues to evolve and serve higher organizational levels through guidelines and policy documentation, we need a dual approach that provides both:
1. Interrogative questions for assessments and checklists
2. Clear declarative/imperative statements for guideline documentation

This dual approach will allow the same rule to be effectively presented in different contexts without duplicating content.

## Decision

We will enhance our rule schema to require both "question" and "statement" properties for each rule:

- **Question**: A brief summary of the rule in interrogative form (e.g., "Does the API include version information in all endpoints?")
- **Statement**: A brief summary of the rule in declarative/imperative form (e.g., "All public APIs must include version information in their endpoints.")

Both properties will be required fields in the rule schema, ensuring that all rules can be presented appropriately in different contexts.

Statements must be clear, specific, and actionable. They should use imperative language that clearly communicates what must be done, rather than vague directives like "Use API Versioning" or "Use HTTPS."

## Consequences

Implementing this decision will provide the following benefits:

- **Versatile Presentation**: Rules can be presented appropriately in different contextsâ€”questions for assessments and statements for guidelines.
- **Consistent Messaging**: The core requirements remain consistent regardless of presentation format.
- **Improved Clarity**: Declarative statements provide clear direction in policy and guideline documentation.
- **Enhanced Assessment Experience**: Interrogative questions maintain the natural flow in assessment and checklist contexts.
- **Organizational Alignment**: This approach better supports EngX's expanding role in providing guidance at higher organizational levels.

The change requires updating existing rules to include both properties, but this effort is justified by the improved flexibility and clarity it provides across different use cases.
